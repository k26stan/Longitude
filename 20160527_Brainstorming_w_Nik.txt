## Brainstorming for Longitudinal Analysis ##

Why is this approach better?
 - Don't throw away data (>6400 observations)
 - Account for correlation structure (~15 measurements/person)
 - Account for placebo
 - Compromise of individual & population level effects (400+ patients)
 - Posterior distributions (probability of response)

What do I want to do?
 - Validate use of Bayesian priors
   - Test different sample sizes, means, & variances
   - How do priors affect results?
 - Build best Null model
   - Test fixed effects
   - Test random effects
   - Test correlation structures
   - WIC/LOO to compare
 - Compare BRM_LMM model to...
   - Models
	   - "Single Timepoint" model(s)
	   - "Mean" model
	     - Simple...but few other advantages
	   - "Fixed Regression" model
	     - (similar to Mean)
	   - "Individual BRM" model
	     - Still gives individual posterior distributions...
	     - ...but w/o random effects
   - What features to compare?
     - Shrinkage
     - Power?
     - Response profiles
     - 
 - Integrate genetics
   - Sparse model w/ priors weighted to 0
     - Like penalized regression approaches
   - Individual models w/ variants or HLA
   - Use priors from literature

Coding PBO: PLAC vs TRT
 - Ability to distinguish "Treatment" from "Drug" effects
 - Total effect = Drug + Treatment
 - 

What specific questions do I want to answer?
 - Can this approach be used to predict future timepoints for individuals?
   - e.g., Train on wks 1:50, predict 50:100
   - e.g., Stagger start times of patients, predict patients who haven't received drug yet
 - How accurately can I impute missing values?
 - Can we predict who dropped from trial?
   - May have to run again w/ all patients (currently 14 removed)

Spitballing:
 - Run model w/ 3 timepoints for each person
   - compare posterior probs...should be around 40-60% probability of response
 - pull 900 data points
   - 15*60 or 3*300
   - compare posteriors probs for overlapping patients
   * Kris:
     - Downsample to N data points (randomly)
     - Calculate Distance from Population Mean
     - Compare vs # observations
       - E.g., if only 1 observation on "DRUG", the random beta should be near population mean.
 - Compare variance of DRUG posteriors from patients in "GOL" arm to other arms
   - Having only 1 bl measurement may increase uncertainty of posteriors
